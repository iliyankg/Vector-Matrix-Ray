# Vector, Matrix and Ray
'Physics for Computer Graphics' project for basic calculations.

This library is used in two projects:
* [Breakout Game] (https://github.com/iliyankg/BreakoutGameRepo)
* [Solar System] (https://github.com/iliyankg/OpenGL-GLUT--Solar-System)

This library was created as a building block for a later project.

The main difficulty encountered was taking into account all the edge casses possible with the 'Ray' operations.
